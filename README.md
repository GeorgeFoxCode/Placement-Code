# Placement-Code
This is a sample code that I wrote in my sparetime. The purpose was to help an issue I had during one of my assignments.

THE ISSUE:

For my Assignment I was using prime numbers consistently, but I didn't have them memorised.
Therefore meaning that I had to look them up on the internet or write them down.
The problem with these solutions is that they are both temporary - should I ever need to use prime numbers again I would need to find the 
note that I wrote them down on or look them up again. 
One possible solution would be to memorise the first x amount needed - however there are problems with this solution.
1) I could forget them eventually rendering the memorisation partically useless if I ever needed primes again.
2) If I needed any prime larger than the ones memorised I would have to resort back to the first two solutions.

MY SOLUTION:
In order to solve ever issue in this problem I created a function that allows the user to input a range of numbers, and the program will
find every prime number in between the two parameters. This solves ever issue because:
1) The code is re-usable
2) Requires no internet connection
3) Can find every prime number between two values regardless of the size.
